You can start here :)

Welcome to my upside down world!
Try to not get lost. If you feel like it, DON'T PANIC! 
Grabe your towel and came along...

You will find in:

    - OO Folder:
        -  ByteBank system: it is the activity that was workerd in the c# oo course.
                            Basic concepts about how to build a class, properties, methods, etc.
                            Some classes of this system have been updated as I am watching more c# courses.

        - Delivery system: it was an extra activity from the same course.
                            The original idea was to create only the classes and references, but, I wanted to understand a little bit more about methods and I gave it a try. I got lost for a while, but I figured out some "solutions", however, I am not happy yet. There are some improvements I want to make in there (you will see some comments in the code)

    - Heran√ßa Folder:
        - ByteBank_ADM system: it is the activity that was worked in the inheretance c# course.
                                Concepts of inheretance, abstract classes and interfaces. There were a lot of refactoring of the code during the course and this is the final result.

        - Library: Extra (and very basic) activity from the same course to excercise inheretance concept.

        - OperacoesMatematicas: It was an extra activity from the inheretance course but I believe the purpose was to excercise OO concept as well. I want to improve this one in the future, somehow, with inheretance.

    - StringsExpressoesRegularesClasseObject Folder: as its name suggests, it was an activity worked on a c# course about strings concepts, interpolation, classe object and regular expressions.
    Also, I need to get deep down a little bit more on regex.

    - ArraysETiposGenericos Folder: activities worked on a c# course about arrays, how to manipulate it and the course will also talk about generic types. It is in progress (aug, 26th, 2022).


In the Program.cs file you will find some daydreams I wrote to practice my systems features. They are all commented, so, you know what to do (uncomment, test, just don't erase it, they are kind of my notes).

Thank you for your visit!
